# MovieApp
Xcode Test project to fetch list of movies

Assignment - Movie App

I have completed the project as your requirements.
Xcode 8.2.1
Swift 3.0
Suggestion list would be saved when user tap home button. Even when the app is
terminated and user open the app , list will be showing.
Third party library Alamofire is integrated for web services . I may use native
NSURLSession API for data tasks but Library simplify the json response handling.
